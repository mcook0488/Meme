## Invent a Meme

A meme based on the viewpoint of signing off a quality assurance development cycle:

## Creating a Meme

The reproduction steps were very simple as I used the https://memegen.link URL as the basis to generate the link:

1. The base of the meme was to use a meme generater URL such as https://memegen.link
2. Add the name of the image the user wishes to use for the meme to the URL; https://memegen.link/success/
3. The following additions to the URL are in regards to the text which will be displayed on the URL with breakpoints between the top and bottom of the image; https://memegen.link/success/quality_assurance/like_a_pro
4. The file format of .jpg (JPEG) is added to the end of URL in order to fully display the meme as an image.

An API to generate meme images based solely on requested URLs. The API is stateless so URLs contain all the information necessary to generate meme images.

## Reason for Meme

The reason for why this meme was invented was to reference every member of the quality assurance team's reaction to the relief and pride of completing the project of a development life cycle successfully.
